## Introduction
* Sentiment analysis on twitter related to COVID-19 based on presidential election in 2020
* Run Twitter API every day
* Collect all tweets relevant to both Donald Trump and Joe Biden
* Extract data relevant to Covid-19 from tweets above
* Analyze attitudes of Covid-19 


## Features
* Tweets collection
* Diagrams
* WordCloud Implementation


## Run & Execute: 
	> python3 ExtractTweets.py  	
	> Python3 Main.py		 


Note*: The tweets data will be extracted into the CSV file. Since the program can only extract tweets by the current time, if you would like to extract more days data, you probably should run the program every day before starting running the analysis part. All commands should be running in the terminal in the correct directory.
